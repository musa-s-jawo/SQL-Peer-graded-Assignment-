                                                       Part 2: Inferences and Analysis
                                     Question 1
Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
       i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
             No, distribution of hours 


      ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
             Yes, base on counting the number of reviews from my analysis 
         
         
     iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
            No, because Location data is not sufficent to conclude as related to how a business is rate


           SQL code used for analysis:
                 SELECT * FROM business WHERE city like '%Vegas%' 
                   GROUP BY stars
                     ORDER BY stars DESC


                                        Question 2
Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that 
are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
                i. Difference 1:
                          Type of business 
         
         
                ii. Difference 2:
                            Location
         
         
                  SQL code used for analysis:
                         SELECT name, city, stars, is_open, review_count, 
                             FROM business
                               GROUP BY is_open 
                                     ORDER BY stars DESC




                                                    Question 3 
	
 For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies
 between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
                   i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
                        what enables business to be rated a top one among the rest
         
         
                   ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  
                   iii. Output of your finished dataset:
